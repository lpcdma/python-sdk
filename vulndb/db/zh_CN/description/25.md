HTTP本身就是无状态协议. 因此服务器无法确定哪个客户端执行了哪些请求，以及哪些
客户端已通过身份验证或未经身份验证.

The use of HTTP cookies
within the headers, allows a web server to identify each individual
client and can therefore determine which clients hold valid
authentication, from those that do not. These are known as session
cookies.
在标头中使用HTTP cookie，允许Web服务器识别每个单独的客户端，可以确定
哪些客户端持有有效的身份验证. 这些被称为会话cookie.

When a cookie is set by the server (sent the header of an
HTTP response) there are several flags that can be set to configure
the properties of the cookie and how it is to be handled by the
browser.
当服务器设置cookie（发送HTTP响应的标头）时，可以设置几个标志来配置cookie
的属性以及如何由浏览器处理它.

One of these flags is known as the `secure` flag. When the
secure flag is set, the browser will prevent it from being sent over a
clear text channel (HTTP) and only allow it to be sent when an
encrypted channel is used (HTTPS).

The tool discovered that a cookie
was set by the server without the secure flag being set. Although the
initial setting of this cookie was via an HTTPS connection, any HTTP
link to the same server will result in the cookie being send in clear
text.
